# 🤖 Coding Ninja Multi-Agent Chatbot

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Students and learners often struggle to find accurate and prompt answers related to:

* Customer support queries (refunds, enrollment, etc.)
* Content or documentation on the Coding Ninjas website
* Coding help and debugging
* Course recommendations based on their interests
* Interview preparation materials
* Project ideas aligned with their skillsets

**Manual support is time-consuming, often generic, and lacks personalization.**

### 💡 Why Multi-Agent AI?

AI Agents are ideal here because:

* They can specialize in distinct domains, improving accuracy and relevance.
* Multi-agent collaboration ensures the system can delegate user queries to the most suitable agent.
* This results in faster, modular, and context-aware responses, improving user satisfaction drastically.

Instead of building a monolithic chatbot, using **specialized agents** for each query type enables the system to scale, adapt, and deliver **expert-level interaction per domain**.

## 🛠️ Project Description

The **Coding Ninja Multi-Agent Chatbot** is an intelligent assistant that intelligently routes and answers queries using a network of task-specific AI agents:

### 🧠 Supported Agents

1. **Customer Support Agent** – Handles account, payment, and support-related queries.
2. **Content Fetcher Agent** – Scrapes and summarizes relevant content from the Coding Ninjas website.
3. **Code Helper Agent** – Helps debug or write code with explanations and examples.
4. **Course Advisor Agent** – Recommends Coding Ninjas courses based on goals.
5. **Interview Prep Agent** – Offers mock questions, answers, and prep tips.
6. **Project Ideas Agent** – Suggests project ideas based on user interests and skills.

### 🔄 How Agents Collaborate

* A **router node** powered by keyword-based logic routes incoming user queries to the most appropriate agent.
* Each agent works independently but conforms to a unified response structure.
* The **state machine graph** (via LangGraph) manages agent transitions and execution paths.

## 🧠 LLM Selection

### ✅ Ideal LLM for Production:

* ** Groq api for faster inference **
* *** model name :-  "deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b" ***
  

### 🆓 Free-Tier / Open-Source LLMs Considered:

* **[Groq API](https://console.groq.com/playground?model=deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b)**

### 🎯 Justification for LLM Choices:

* **Performance-Driven**: Groq-hosted DeepSeek LLaMA 70B offers high speed and cost-efficiency for real-time apps.
* **Domain Versatility**: DeepSeek  provide good performance for summarization and Q\&A with prompt-tuning.
* **Cost Consideration**: Used Groq + DeepSeek for zero-cost high-speed inference during development and demo stages.

## 📦 How to Run

### Backend (FastAPI)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Frontend (Streamlit)

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Ensure `.env` contains your Groq API key or substitute with any supported LLM.
